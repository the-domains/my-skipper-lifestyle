The Decision Book: Eisenhower Model 

**Important but NOT URGENT: **

1. Drafting to Wim Hoff---Connecting to The Skipper Lifestyle 
2. Partnership/Sponsorship like Thiel Fellowship (i.e.. take only a semester off---after TYW summer---and sail across Atlantic)
3. Partnering with Sam Evans---Creating a _automated service_ "editing e-course" for aspiring photographer/skipper & to provide more valuable shooting techniques/settings information to the guests. --- Brought to you by TSL/Skippers
4. Using Webinars (how to use this as a package?)---Partner agreements with Marina Sailing & alike --- but for greater purposes like telling your story and understanding what you'll get into 

**NOT IMPORTANT but NOT URGENT: **

1. Responding to Maryland Sailing

**Urgent but NOT IMPORTANT:**

1. Contacting RQI for writing tips 
2. Contacting Warren Berger about Environment TYW Creates---similar to environment with children 4-5yrs old. 
3. Sending _Videos_to__ Trevor Cochran. 

**URGENT AND IMPORTANT: **

1. Understanding Key Metrics to current website and business plan. 
2. Communication to subscribers. Email Newsletter --- Weekly Reviews & testing email lists --- Providing updates and resources to help automate recruitment process.
3. What does a partnership with Universities - TSL - Sailing Schools - Skipper Academy look like? ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/eaa91c9d-9d87-4815-8419-603eec4b9bac.png)
