NAUTIKA CENTAR NAVA

Quite possibly the best charter company I had this summer. 

My crew was great, but also a great location and starting point for their week. Based right out of ACI Split Marina, "Nava" is a easy departure from start to finish. 

So as I get ready to go back to Croatia I wanted to recommend some companies to my friends and family that will inevitably need to book from someone.

Might as well start with my best experience. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5acf1758-c6af-4a8c-a83e-003c54788fa0.png)

I'd start at one of these. 

And if you want to go bigger, book a catamaran in a heart beat.
