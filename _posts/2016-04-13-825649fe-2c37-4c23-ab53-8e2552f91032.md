I think the first thing to address is the topic of "Am I Producing Great Work" and what exactly is my expectation of Great Work.

"People over estimate what they can do in a week, and underestimate what hey can do in a year."

How you've built momentum so far comes from making the discoveries. Maybe that was reaching out to a captain (and having an appropriate opportunity to do so, and CRUSHING IT--- in the cold call) and learning more about what is available in the sailing industry and providing new connections you need to make for your brand.

^^Good example, so how did you make that discovery? --- You were learning about ASA and the capabilities that your license has in the present state.

Living in the present has a huge impact on building momentum. You need to live in the present to realize what you have---and that which you desire.

By living in the present you've been able to understand more about what you don't know, and what you don't know is out there, you just need to find it. 

This is the foundation. ---  You don't know, what you don't know. 

Specific example: You don't know that you can't find work outside the Yacht Week with your ASA license. You assume you can't but you don't know. Maybe you just need a better network to learn from i.e.. Captain Rick with USCG and Capt. John with ASA.

So the next objective is to build momentum that provides daily output of producing great work? 

Having a schedule helps. Having an accurate schedule of what you can accomplish in one week will also help. Having a realistic time-line, down to hours needed to produce "great work." And being prepared on the front end of these things. --- you can't just write a blog, you need an inspiration, and outline, and research to provide at the end for those who want more facts. 

My expectation of great work creates momentum. 

My expectation of great work comes from seeing results (or feedback good/bad ie. posting blogs) 

My expectation of great work involves applying what I've learned, but not necessarily applying what I've learned right now. 

My expectation of great work doesn't make me feel rushed. --- Meditation & Daily Journal

My expectation of great work doesn't involve organizing, re-organizing, and seeing the same things just in different places. 

My understanding of great work comes from being prepared.
