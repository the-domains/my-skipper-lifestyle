Seeing the YouTube Videos I knew I wanted to spend my summer doing just that, sailing around the islands of Croatia, adventuring off on scooters with the crews, partying my ass off in the castles.</p><p>I knew we were going to sail, so when I was planning and preparing for it all, I didn't spend too much time actually thinking about sailing.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because I really didn't know that much about sailing, so I couldn't picture exactly what the boat would look like moving through the water. I'd never been on the larger boats, never felt the heel and the feeling at the helm with the wind in your sails.</p><p>What I knew was near to nothing, so the biggest challenge was going to be self discipline. Going from a big university, parties every night, sleeping off hangovers, and a minimal class schedule - To creating my own agenda wasn't something I was used too (and I'm still not). </p><p>Thinking about going from island to island each morning was my motivation. </p><p>The first week of skippering was an epic fail in self-discipline. Not working out once, succumbing to every little offer to join a new group of people, and leaving very little time myself. I hadn't begun any meditation practice. </p><p>Before I came to the yacht week, I was working out on a pretty consistent basis. Probably going to the gym about 3-4 days a week with some extra activities on the side like golf, basketball, or the occasional smoke a bowl and jog.</p><p>I'd say the my workout consistency was about a 7/10 so you can judge your level.</p><ul><li>Reference to 7 master skills: preparation and believing in yourself.</li></ul><p>What took place was the domino effect. The concept is very simple, you may have heard this term before, my best understanding came from Jay Papasans book: <u><a href="http://amzn.to/1SfGzkw">The One Thing</a></u></p><p>What led me to discover this book is another story (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/lewishowes/jay-papasan">see link Lewis Howes & Jay Papasan</a>) but where you can apply this appropriately is in your preparing in learning how to sail.</p><p>What you'll end up generating is a schedule of "The One Thing" that's the absolute most important thing to accomplish each week. You could break it up into days, or keep the weekly model if you appropriate time correctly.</p><p>Each day was a domino, and day after day you fall into the routine of nocking over the wrong domino's. Not what I wanted, but I knew I'd be making it worse by keeping it my mind - my self discipline sticking too my personal principals declaration was being attacked.</p><p><i>"I hadn't created an actually PPD officially yet, but that's because I hadn't had a formula to put it from Pen to paper, aka I've got a mad lack of what some call focus, or vision.I knew what I wanted, and I didn't know what outlined the type of life that I was living or going to continue living."</i></p><p> (working on the PPD right now)</p><p>^^note I want this to be in the process of figuring things out as they go.. Things I've learned here, that there is a time and place to worry about stuff. You're hurting yourself if you constantly worry about the things you can't change. I think for me personally, I started learning this on the way into my junior year. But I saw the beauty in simplicity thinking. Call it island mentality if you will, but the ability to keep yourself balanced between distress and eustress is in your hands.</p><p>So, the moral of the story so far is get ready to be tested, if your looking into becoming a skipper you're in for more than this.</p><p>.... </p><p>"Tie into the fact for Wim Hoff method will be a discipline testing, doing 1 hour a day. The test of minimal physical testing but breathing and focus can best any unplanned course of principals.</p><p>Where can this method, given little that's around us creates an overall zen like benefit in our day to day activities?</p><p>What's your perfect day in the environment you want to live in? It's going to change drastically on the road.</p><p>Traveling, meeting people, figuring yourself out, and creating time is an amazing journey. Time allows for speeds up. Meditation allows time to be present."</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="18"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="19"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="20"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="21"><span data-reactid="22"><!-- react-empty: 23 --><h2 data-reactid="24"><a data-reactid="25">My Skipper Lifestyle</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="27"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="28"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="29"></div></section></div></div>
